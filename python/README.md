This was one of my first Python programs. I translated part of the Wiki Project into Python. This would get pictures from Wikipedia (but of course this was before I understood HTML, so I beleive I did it the hard way; probably should not use XML). I have no guarentee if this still works as it was last tested in late 2014.

_Please note that this is "seperate" from the Wiki Project._
