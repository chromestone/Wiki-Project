The purpose of this project was to collect information from Wikipedia and then create a set of trivia questions. The questions would be displayed with an image. However, it seems linguistics is still a bit out of reach for my skills.

Also please note this was before I understood HTML, so many I probably did this the hardway. I have no guarentee if this still works as it was last tested in late 2014.
