This was one of my first python programs. I translated part of the Wiki Project into python. This would get pictures from Wikipedia (but of course this was before I understood HTML, so I beleive I did it the hard way). I have no guarentee if this still works as it was last tested in late 2014.

Please note that this is "seperate" from the Wiki Project.
