# Wiki Project
The purpose of this project was to collect information from Wikipedia and then create a set of trivia questions. The questions would be displayed with an image. However, it seems linguistics was bit out of reach for my skills.

Also please note this was before I understood HTML, so I probably did this the hard way; probably should not use XML. I have no guarentee if this still works as it was last tested in late 2014.
